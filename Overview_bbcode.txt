[size=6][color=#f1c232][u]Overview[/u][/color][/size]
This is a quality-of-life mod to allow the adjusting of troop wages up or down. Also allows adjusting the cost of recruiting soldiers and mercenaries.
Units with horses can have a optional daily wage value set this is added to each individual troop with a horses daily wages.
Can also set the additional amount for recruiting troops with horses, can be set for below tier 4 and tier 4 and above separately.
Optionally if the option 'Companion Recruit Troops cost' then any member of the players clan will use the settings for the player, other wise they use AI settings.

Includes option to increase troop upgrade costs for the player and optionally player clan members.

All multipliers have been separated into player and AI multipliers.

Caravan and Garrison multipliers are applied to the total wages, e.g. a garrison multiplier 0.5 would have the total cost of garrison's.

To have the selected troop view in party screen and the tool tip in the troop upgrade trees reflect the correct wages I have had to implement two harmony patches, 
the exact methods are in the changes. This could cause conflicts if other mods also are changing the two methods mentioned. For the tooltip change the correct wage is shown at 
the bottom of the tool tip and is the best that I could get to work currently.
